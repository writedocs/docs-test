Deets offers MyValet as a tool that serves as a Merchant Account Creator (MAC), providing a straightforward signup form that enables merchants to input their business information, such as contact details, bank account information, and taxpayer identification number, allowing them to receive and retrieve sales payments and split your share in the process.

## MyValet Signup

To start the process, first, send them the MyValet signup link below:

```html URL
https://myvalet.ondeets.ai/sign-up
```

Once your merchant receives and accesses the link, the following page will greet them:

  alt="Onboard Merchants" 
/>

They must input their name and personal contact details, agree to the terms of use, and click **Continue**. After this, the signup process will continue, and the form will ask them to input the relevant information to create their Merchant Account.

Once they finish all the signup steps, they will receive a confirmation email containing their Digitzs ID along with their access information to their MyIQ Dashboard.
