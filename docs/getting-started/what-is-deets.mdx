## Why should you use Deets?

Deets provides a secure way to capture, encrypt, and transmit sensitive customer and payment data. Tokenizing information such as credit card details and bank account information, ensuring you and your merchant's compliance with industry regulations such as the PII, PCI, and HIPAA, reducing your business from their compliance scope, and eliminating friction if a merchant wishes to change gateways. 

Through MyValet, you can easily manage the onboarding of your merchants, leading to increased efficiency and reduced manual workload, allowing them to open a merchant account in real-time, without ever leaving your site, and process transactions immediately.

## How does it work?

First, you onboard your merchants with a referral link, allowing them to establish a merchant account for streamlined payment processing and retrieving earnings from their sales. Also, allowing you to get paid for every sale.

Then, when customers make a transaction, the embedded Deets iFrame code in your platform's checkout will capture, tokenize, and securely store the customer's sensitive information. This ensures strict adherence to industry regulations and compliance standards.
