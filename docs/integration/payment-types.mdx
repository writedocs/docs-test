Deets allow you to perform two types of payments: 

- Regular 
- Split

Read more details on each type in the sections below.

## Regular Payment

Regular payment means the paid amount is not split and is completely sent to the specified merchant. 

The request is made to the [Create Payments](/api-reference/payments/create-payments) endpoint. To authorize it, its headers must contain the generated `appToken` and the `apiKey` that we provided you. For this type of payment, these three parameters of the request body must be configured as follows: 

- `paymentType`: Must be set to `tokenv3` to specify this is a regular payment.
- `merchantId`: This is where you input the MID (Merchant ID).
- `tokenId`: This is where you input the credit card token captured by our iFrame.

See the JSON request body example below.

```json CURL
{
    "data": {
        "type": "payments",
        "attributes": {
            "paymentType": "tokenv3",
            "merchantId": "{{merchantId}}",
            "miscData": "{\"email\":\"johndoe@john.com\",\"originIp\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"customerIp\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"rawData\":\"Lorem ipsum\"}",
            "token": {
                "tokenId": "{{token}}",
                "holder": "Tommy",
                "expiry": "0229",
                "useAVS": true
            },
            "transaction": {
                "amount": "001",
                "currency": "USD",
                "invoice": "PAYMENT-TOKEN-7"
            },
            "billingAddress": {
                "line1": "21 Jump Street",
                "line2": "Suite 007",
                "city": "Los Angeles",
                "state": "CA",
                "zip": "832044716",
                "country": "USA"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Split Payment

When part of the paid amount must be split and sent to a third party, you must make a split payment request.

The request is made to the [Create Split Payments](/api-reference/payment-split/create-split-payments) endpoint. Just like regular payments, the request headers must contain the generated `appToken` and the `apiKey`. For split payments, these three parameters of the request body must be configured as follows:

- `paymentType`: Must be set to `tokenv3Split` to specify this is a split payment.
- `merchantId`: This is where you input the MID (Merchant ID).
- `tokenId`: This is where you input the credit card token captured by our iFrame.
- `split`: This object is where you specify the third-party MID in the`merchantId` parameter and the amount to be split in the `amount` parameter.

See the JSON request body example below.

```json

{
    "data": {
        "type": "payments",
        "attributes": {
            "paymentType": "tokenv3Split",
            "merchantId": "{{merchantId}}",
            "miscData": "{\"email\":\"johndoe@john.com\",\"originIp\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"customerIp\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"rawData\":\"Lorem ipsum\"}",
            "token": {
                "tokenId": "{{token}}",
                "holder": "John Doe",
                "expiry": "0229",
                "useAVS": true
            },
            "transaction": {
                "amount": "500",
                "currency": "USD",
                "invoice": "PAYMENT-TOKEN-7"
            },
            "split": {
                "merchantId": "{{merchantId2}}",
                "amount": "100"
            },
            "billingAddress": {
                "line1": "21 Jump Street",
                "line2": "Suite 007",
                "city": "Los Angeles",
                "state": "CA",
                "zip": "83204",
                "country": "USA"
            }
        }
    }
}
